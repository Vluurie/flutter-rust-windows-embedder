//! Multi-view support for the hardware-accelerated (ANGLE/OpenGL) embedder.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! A single Flutter engine (one isolate, shared Dart state) can drive multiple
//! *views*. View `0` is the **implicit view** — in this crate that is the
//! in-game overlay represented by [`FlutterOverlay`]. Additional views
//! (`view_id > 0`) are created at runtime via [`FlutterEngineAddView`] and each
//! renders into its own GPU texture, which the host composites into a separate
//! top-level HWND/swapchain.
//!
//! The engine is told about views through a [`FlutterCompositor`] supplied in
//! `FlutterProjectArgs`. When a compositor is present, the engine no longer uses
//! the renderer-config `present`/`present_with_info` path; instead it asks the
//! embedder for a *backing store* per layer ([`create_backing_store_callback`])
//! and then presents composed layers per view ([`present_view_callback`]). The
//! `FlutterBackingStoreConfig` and `FlutterPresentViewInfo` both carry a
//! `view_id`, which is how we route frames to the right surface.
//!
//! # Why a registry
//!
//! Every compositor callback receives the `FlutterCompositor.user_data` baton.
//! We set that baton to a pointer to the owning [`FlutterOverlay`] (the engine
//! host). The overlay holds a [`ViewRegistry`] mapping `view_id -> ViewSurface`,
//! so the callbacks can look up the correct GPU resources by `view_id`.
//!
//! [`FlutterEngineAddView`]: crate::bindings::embedder::FlutterEngineAddView
//! [`FlutterOverlay`]: crate::software_renderer::overlay::overlay_impl::FlutterOverlay
